    <h2>Rent-A-Bot</h2>
    <p>Rent-A-Bot is a chaotic co-op game where players control robots in a factory and collaborate to produce computer chips for their clients. The levels feature puzzling and engaging layouts that force the players to collaborate to meet their quotas on time!</p>
    <p>My main work on the game focused primarily on the backend and UX development of the disasters and associated systems. I created the Disaster Queue, a system responsible for managing and randomly triggering events throughout each level in a flexible, customizable, and balanced manner. I also developed all the quick time events used to resolve the disasters, focusing primarily on making them intuitive, satisfying, and fun.</p>
