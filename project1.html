            <h2>Metroid Remake in Unity</h2>
    	    <p>This project is a recreation of the original NES Metroid game within the Unity engine. My early development on the project focused on recreating the door and camera systems authentically. Specific challenges at this stage included finding a way to mimic the unique resource management system of the original game, wherein out-of-view enemies became inactive, and all rooms besides the current one ceased to run. In the more advanced stages of the project, my contributions were primarily towards the design of the custom mechanic and its ecosystem of related components. I was also the lead techincal artist and implemented all the animations, related state machines, and necessary custom sprites.<br>Technologies used in the development of this project include C# and Unity for the primary game mechanic recreation and level design. The custom art assets were designed entirely on Pixilart, an online pixel art editing site. My artwork for this project can be found <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/rahulu/gallery">on my profile there.</a>
