            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Rahul, and I love everything about game dev. Growing up, I'd always seen tech as the field I wanted to go into. As I got older, I realized that what got me so into tech in the first place were the movies, games, and shows that made computer science and engineering seem like the most magical professions. I realized what I'd really fallen in love with was the art of it all. To me, Game Dev represents the perfect intersection of storytelling and engineering, and that's what I want to do: tell stories. Here are some things I've worked on over the years, and I hope to bring you more in the future!</p>
